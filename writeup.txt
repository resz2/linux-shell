To run the shell, use command:
-> make

This will compile the external command codes and the shell code, and then run the shell.
Once you exit the shell it will clear the intermediate files produced.

If an error is encountered during shell use, then files can be cleared using:
-> make clear

or alternatively, you can run the shell again using:
-> make run

Some commands to test the working of the shell:

ls
ls help
cd help
pwd
cd ..
pwd
date
date -u
echo hello there!
mkdir t1
mkdir t2/t3
mkdir -p t2/t3
rm t1
rm -d t1
rm -d t2
rm -r t2
cat help/pwd.txt
mkdir --help
history
exit
